This was a research project that I conducted with two of my classmates in a course I was enrolled in at Carnegie Mellon University called "Introduction to Deep Learning." The project focused on developing an efficient model for categorizing multiple cardiac conditions using various CNN architectures, particularly variations of ResNet models. This was not our primary idea because there was a challenge at PhysioNet with the same concept. Our main objective was to build a deep learning algorithm that is more accurate than the one developed by the PhysioNet Challenge 2020 winner. Their work can be found in the paper titled "Adaptive Lead Weighted ResNet Trained with Different Duration Signals for Classifying 12-lead ECGs" by Zhibin et al.

To bring this work to completion, we used the Python programming tool with a Google Cloud virtual machine because we trained our model on a large dataset, and Google Cloud was used to increase the training speed. Other methods included data acquisition, which sourced data from various publicly available 12-lead ECG recording datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2020), data preprocessing, as well as model development and evaluation.

This project emphasizes the use of deep neural networks for classifying multilabel 12-Lead ECG readings, conducting a comparative study of existing deep neural network models. It addresses the global scarcity of cardiology experts and the intricate nature of cardiac diagnostics. Our modified resnet-18 algorithm, incorporating adjustments to learning rates, optimizer, and padding, outperformed our baseline model by 1.3%, marking a successful endeavor. Despite challenges posed by a diverse dataset from different sources, deep learning networks showcased the potential for classifying ECG readings, suggesting future applications in diagnostics.
